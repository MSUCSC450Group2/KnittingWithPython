# KnittingWithPython
Repository for the students of group 2

We should not create separate apps for every web page, they all should be in WebPages folder.
All necessary files, except for html files, from login are moved into WebPages. 
WebPages/views.py and WebPages/tests.py paths should be adjusted.
Four html files from login/templates/login/registration should be moved into static/templates;
  in this case they can use base.html bootstrap header/footer; 
  if this is done, the whole login folder can be deleted.
